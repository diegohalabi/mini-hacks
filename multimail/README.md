# Python Multimail

A straightforward hack to send many personalized mails at once, attached with one or more files.

## Use

1. Compose the message in the `template.txt` file
2. Create or edit the list of recipient mail and customizable features in the `mail_list.csv`.
3. Edit the rest of the mail in the `main.py`.
4. Run the script and take advantage of the time saved to do exciting things.

## Strengths:

* Allows reviewing in detail the list of recipients before sending several emails.
* Prevents forgetting attached files since the script does it automatically.
* The messages are highly personalized.
* I can spend my time doing more exciting and creative tasks than sending dozens of boring emails!

## Limitations:

* The attachment module only works with Gmail (my university officially use Office365), which must be set to a low-security level. I hope to solve this soon cause it is a problem for me.
