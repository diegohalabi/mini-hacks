# Python Multimail

A very simple hack to send a lot of personalized emails at once, attached with one or more files.

## Use

1. Compose the message in the `template.txt` file
2. Create or edit the list of recipient mail and customizable features in the `mail_list.csv`.
3. Edit the rest of the mail in the `main.py`.
4. Run the script and take advantage of the time gained doing interesting things.

## Advantages:

* Allows to review in detail the list of recipients before sending several emails.
* It prevents to forget attached files, since the script does it automatically.
* The messages are highly personalized.
* I can spend my time doing much more interesting and creative things than sending dozens of boring emails!

## Limitations:

* The attachment module only works with Gmail (at my university we officially use Office365), which must be set to a low security level.  I hope to solve this soon, because it is a big problem.
